subtitle: A memo about The Lab.

Welcome to The Lab. We don't have a fun acronym, and we're struggling to trademark such a common word, but no matter. We're excited to have you on our cybersecurity team.

The Lab is dedicated to scientific research of organisms in space, including so-described "aliens." 

Our network is rather small but growing. Our sole administrator, John Williams, is entirely responsible for cybersecurity. Except for you now, of course. John has provided you a network topology. It confuses me but that's why we pay you the big bucks!

A few things our CIO, Gregory Luckus, wanted you to know before you get inundated with paperwork from HR:

- Uptime is critical to our mission. We can't have systems turning off willy nilly or being interrupted in the middle of calculations.
- Gregory said were sold Splunk by our former third-party SOC, but we have since realized that Elastic is free. I assume those words mean something to you. Free is probably a good thing.
- Our cyber insurance is expensive and we would like to get rid of it. That's why you're here! You're our insurance, I suppose!

Best of luck.

    I work on these scenarios for my own education when I have downtime during work hours as training, or when I'm bored at home as fun. Please suspend your disbelief for large gaps between timestamps. Sometimes I set this down for weeks and come back to it. If it helps, think of it as the adversary dwelling in the environment! :)
