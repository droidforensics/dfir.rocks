Hi, I'm Droid! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for stopping by, it's great to see you today.

  I'm a DFIR practitioner and enthusiast working in the public sector. I like to learn - <b>a lot</b>. It's my favorite pastime. Part of how I learn best is by sharing what I know with others and helping teach them in my own small way.
  
  I'm dedicating this site to that purpose, with a catch: <b>I'd love your contributions! Yes, YOURS!</b> I would like to hear from you, get your opinion on content, and even welcome you to make changes that you think would benefit the broader cybersecurity community. To hear more, please see the [contribution document](docs/contributing.md).

  Otherwise, consider diving in to the [knowledge corpus](/docs) or check out the [blog](/blog).

Again, it was great to see you today, I hope you're well, and remember to keep on chugging along! ðŸš‚
