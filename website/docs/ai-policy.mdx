Generative AI can provide *some value* to cybersecurity analysts. It would be disingenous to suggest that models can't be helpful for things like skeletoning a Sigma rule or identifying a common error in a Python script you wrote.

That said, I believe there are serious ethical problems with the widespread use of AI (including the well known Large Language Models like ChatGPT and Claude). I have ever so slightly less of a concern with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models.

This site is governed by the following policy on AI, including community contributions:

1. A page may contain 30% AI-*assisted* content at most.

2. If an author chooses to utilize AI for any part of the writing process, they must include the banner seen below.
3. AI-generated images are strictly forbidden. Support human artists.
4. Any AI-assisted content is checked by a human for accuracy and completeness.

The banner and its usage is seen below:
